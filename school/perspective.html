        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Maduravoyal G.H.S.S not only recognises talent in both the curriculum and extracurricular activities, but also encourages students to participate and give it their all.<br><br>
        Throughout the years, we have all been encouraged to interact and engage with our peers.<br><br>
        The relationships formed with the teachers, staff and students are something to remember for the entirety of one’s life. This school has taught me how to drive myself to new heights in order to surpass my personal bests and progress on a continuous basis. Going through these years of school has been a fantastic experience that I will never forget.<br><br>

        <fieldset><p>The past year has been a roller coaster ride for many of us and it continues to demand every ounce of faith, resolve and determination. COVID 19 not only took us by surprise but it upended everything we knew and believed to be “normal”. Life almost came to a stand still. The fear of uncertainty reigned supreme and as a parent I worried about the future of my kids, especially my 8 year old daughter. The formative years of education are critical to growth and  development for every child and any disruption would have disastrous consequences.<br><br>
        I did not have to worry thanks to the formidable team of teachers of Grade 3 A, Mrs. Leema Maleeni, Mrs Jincy Vishal, Mrs. Sona John, Mrs Vadivambigai and Mrs. Freeda.<br><br>

        We are extremely happy with all that the School has offered our children. We are pleased with the ethos of the School, which aspires to identify each child&#39;s capabilities & provides an environment that enables all children to achieve their potential. The School is proactive in ensuring the overall development of the child and the quality of teaching is excellent!<br><br>
        With regards,<br>Kalpana Prakash</p>

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The teachers and the staff of The school have been fantastic throughout the year showing personal attention to each student. They have shown tremendous commitment and dedication in conducting on-line classes overcoming socio-technical challenges thrown by pandemic. The teachers exhibited unparalleled patience levels in controlling and keeping the kids attentive during the classes throughout the academic year. They never compromised on quality of teaching despite their own personal commitments/challenges/issues due to lock-down and ensured high standards of education. They quickly adapted to the new normal and lead by example for the students.<br><br>
        The passion and perseverance of all these stakeholders resulted in successful completion of this academic year and gave complete confidence for the upcoming year.<br><br>
